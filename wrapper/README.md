A full-fledged wrapper which uses a scrapper to replicate functionality the official API used to have. It will be in client format and will include functions such as: downloading, sorting, searching, filtering and retrieving doujins from the website. It also makes use of the weird remains of the API via requesting data in json form to complement the scrapper.
This will be the one I work on the most since the scrapper is a more grab-and-use tool which doesn't require any further knowledge. Enjoy.
