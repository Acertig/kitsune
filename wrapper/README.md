A mix of both scrapper and router. It mantains the functionality of the scrapper but remains much more complex and superior functionality-wise to it's predecessor. 
This will be the one I work on the most since the scrapper is a more grab-and-use tool which doesn't require any further knowledge. Enjoy.
