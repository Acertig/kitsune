# Kitsune | An asynchronous nhentai.net API wrapper and scraper
Only contributions I allow will be accepted. This will be worked on only in my free time. 

Current capabilities: 

- Doujin retrieving from nhentai API
- Searching and filtering with webscraping
- Ratelimiting and fast requests / 25 requests per 6 seconds individually requesting each
- Easy to use
- Efficient downloading

Pre-release: 

- Extra polishing, some extra refactoring and last touches.
- Licensing, uploading the package and guide on how to use.

Post-release: 
- Even more refactoring. 
- Simple GUI to download media using the wrapper.

Special thanks to hentai-chan for sharing the API endpoints. They were necessary for this async version of the wrapper to work.
