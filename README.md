![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67067768/139630315-8822160e-67da-48cc-9043-cefd41f30bb8.png)
Only contributions I allow will be accepted. This will be worked on only in my free time. 

### Current capabilities: 

- nhentai.net API endpoints data requesting 
- Searching and filtering with webscraping
- Ratelimit handling
- Downloading done via threads

### Pre-release: 

- Extra polishing, some extra refactoring and last touches.
- Licensing, uploading the package and guide on how to use.

### Post-release: 
- Even more refactoring. 
- Tweaks and changes for the http handler.

Special thanks to hentai-chan for sharing the API endpoints. They were necessary for this async version of the wrapper to work.
