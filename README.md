# Kitsune | A nhentai.net API wrapper and scraper
Only contributions I allow will be accepted. This will be worked on only in my free time. 

NOTE: Kitsune is the main form and the one for you if you want a broad range of capabilities. Otherwise, use the scrapper. 

Current capabilities: 

- Doujin retrieving from nhentai API
- Searching and filtering with webscraping

To be done: 
 
- Some refactoring: names, structure, everything
- Comment and user retrieving
- Downloading
- Further searching filtering options
- Handling ratelimits for faster requests: when testing, gallery retrieving sits at 9, this number could be reduced to 6, so that's what I'm aiming for at the moment.
