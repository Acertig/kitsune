# Kitsune | A nhentai.net API wrapper and scraper
Only contributions I allow will be accepted. This will be worked on only in my free time. 

Current capabilities: 

- Doujin retrieving from nhentai API
- Searching and filtering with webscraping

To be done: 
 
- Some refactoring: names, structure, everything
- Comment retrieving
- Downloading
- Further searching filtering options
- Faster requests
